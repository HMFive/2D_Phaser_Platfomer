            <div>
              <p>
               My name is Yusuf Çiftci and I am 20 years old. I join the competition from Samsun.
               I am currently studying IST at Bilkent University(formerly known as CTIS!)

            <h3>What do I do?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>
                Nothing. Except entering exams and laying down

            <h3>Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>
                I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a
                Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so
                powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the
                midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the
                dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from
                dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities
                some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only
                thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually,
                of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice
                everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.
                Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
